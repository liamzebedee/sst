Requirements
------------

Software package dependencies:		Can be obtained from:
	- OpenSSL libraries		openssl.org
	- Qt 4 GUI toolkit		trolltech.com


Building and Installing
-----------------------

To check out from Subversion and set up the configure scripts:
  svn co svn://svn.pdos.csail.mit.edu/uia/trunk/uia/sst
  cd sst
  ./misc/setup

To build and install:
  ./configure [--prefix=<install-location>]
  make
  make install


Using SST
---------

...modes of use...

...event loop integration:
(a) if your app uses Qt...
(b) if your app uses glib...  Qt 4.2 contains built-in support
	for integration with glib's event loop.
	Make sure Qt was compiled and installed with
	glib support (the -glib option on the configure line).
	Qt will then by default use glib's main event loop instead of its own.
(c) if neither of the above apply, implement a few callback functions...

License
-------

The SST prototype implemenation relies on the Qt 4 toolkit from Trolltech, now
part of Nokia.  Qt versions 4.0 through 4.4 were released under the GNU General
Public License, version 2, which meant that SST had to be released under this
license as well since SST must be linked with Qt.

Nokia announced in January 2009 that starting with Qt version 4.5, the open
source release of Qt would be made available under the more liberal GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL), which allows proprietery programs to be linked
with LGPL-licensed libraries.  We have already updated SST's licensing terms to
match (see COPYING-LGPL for details).  Note however that the more liberal terms
will only be available when using SST with Qt 4.5 or later once Qt 4.5 becomes
available.  Please feel free to contact us if you would like to use Qt but have
concerns about licensing issues.
