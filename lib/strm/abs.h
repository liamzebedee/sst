 * so that SST can hold onto a stream's state and gracefully shut it down
 * after the application deletes its Stream object representing it.
 * This separation also keeps the internal stream control variables
 * out of the public C++ API header files and thus able to change
 * without breaking binary compatibility,
 * and makes it easy to implement service/protocol negotiation
 * for top-level application streams by extending this class
 * (e.g., see ConnectStream).
