This directory contains a test client/server
that simulates web-like communication patterns over SST or TCP,
driven by the UC Berkeley Home IP Web Traces
available from the Internet Traffic archive at:

	http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/

To run the client, place the appropriate (un-gzipped) trace
into the current directory in a file called 'trace'.
