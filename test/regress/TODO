Regression tests needed:

substreams:
- create a lot of substreams rapidly, hold onto them, use them once in a while
- create and destroy a lot of substreams in rapid succession
- rapidly create a deep hierarchy of nested substreams

datagrams:
- send a stream of datagrams of widely varying size
- send a mix of datagram substreams and real two-way substreams

flow control:
- flow control for byte streams
- receive window borrowing
- receive window borrowing for datagram substreams
- inherited versus independent receive windows
