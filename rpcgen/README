Version of Sun's rpcgen modified to produce C++/Qt XDR stubs.
(RPC currently not supported.)

The current mapping for unions is convenient but very inefficient:
the in-memory representation just contains an instance of each case,
only one of which ever gets used at a time.
Probably not too much of a problem when the mapped in-memory structure
is only used ephemerally and not in long-term data structures.

The mapping for fixed-length and variable-length arrays is the same:
they both use QList<> (or QByteArray for XDR's special 'opaque' type).
Always using QLists tends to be more convenient than using C++'s
legacy C-style fixed-length arrays, though slightly less efficient.

Language enhancements:
- New length-delimited option type declarator: 'type ?var'.
  Like 'type *var' but robust against failures in processing 'var'.
- Accepts C++-style '//' line comments
- XDR 'string' type assumed to be encoded in UTF-8

Potential language enhancements TODO:
- Accept redundant ',' at end of enum blocks.
