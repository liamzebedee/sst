/** This class represents an SST stream.
 * This is the primary high-level class that client applications use
 * to communicate over the network via SST.
 * The class provides standard stream-oriented read/write functionality
 * via the methods in its QIODevice base class,
 * and adds SST-specific methods for controlling SST streams and substreams.
 *
 * To initiate an outgoing "top-level" SST stream to a remote host,
 * the client application creates a Stream instance
 * and then calls connectTo().
 * To initiate a sub-stream from an existing stream,
 * the application calls openSubstream() on the parent stream.
 *
 * To accept incoming top-level streams from other hosts
 * the application creates a StreamServer instance,
 * and that class creates Stream instances for incoming connections.
 * To accept new incoming substreams on existing streams,
 * the application calls listen() on the parent stream,
 * and upon arrival of a newSubstream() signal
 * the application calls acceptSubstream()
 * to obtain a Stream object for the new incoming substream.
 *
 * SST uses service and protocol names
 * in place of the port numbers used by TCP and UDP
 * to differentiate and select among different application protocols.
 * A service name represents an abstract service being provided:
 * e.g., "Web", "File", "E-mail", etc.
 * A protocol name represents a concrete application protocol
 * to be used for communication with an abstract service:
 * e.g., "HTTP 1.0" or "HTTP 1.1" for communication with a "Web" service;
 * "FTP", "NFS v4", or "CIFS" for communication with a "File" service;
 * "SMTP", "POP3", or "IMAP4" for communication with an "E-mail" service.
 * Service names are intended to be suitable for non-technical users to see,
 * in a service manager or firewall configuration utility for example,
 * while protocol names are primarily intended for application developers.
 * A server can support multiple distinct protocols on one logical service,
 * for backward compatibility or functional modularity reasons for example,
 * by registering to listen on multiple (service, protocol) name pairs.

	////////// Connection //////////

	/** Connect to a given service and protocol on a remote host.
	 * The stream logically goes into the "connected" state immediately
	 * (i.e., isConnected() returns true),
	 * and the application may start writing to the stream immediately,
	 * but actual network connectivity may not be established
	 * until later or not at all.
	 * Either during or some time after the connectTo() call,
	 * SST emits the linkUp() signal to indicate active connectivity,
	 * or linkDown() to indicate connectivity could not be established.
	 * A linkDown() signal is not necessarily fatal, however:
	 * unless the application disconnects or deletes the Stream object,
	 * SST will continue attempting to establish connectivity
	 * and emit linkUp() if and when it eventually succeeds.
	 *
	 * If the stream is already connected when connectTo() is called,
	 * SST immediately re-binds the Stream object to the new target
	 * but closes the old stream gracefully in the background.
	 * Similarly, SST closes the stream gracefully in the background
	 * if the application just deletes a connected Stream object.
	 * To close a stream forcefully without retaining internal state,
	 * the application may explicitly call shutdown(Reset)
	 * before re-connecting or deleting the Stream object.
	 * 
	 * @param dstid the endpoint identifier (EID)
	 *		of the desired remote host to connect to.
	 *		The destination may be either a cryptographic EID
	 * 		or a non-cryptographic legacy address
	 *		as defined by the Ident class.
	 *		The dstid may also be empty,
	 *		indicating that the destination's identity is unknown;
	 *		in this case the caller must provide a location hint
	 *		via the dstep argument.
	 * @param service the service name to connect to on the remote host.
	 * @param protocol the application protocol name to connect to.
	 * @param dstep	an optional location hint
	 *		for SST to use in attempting to contact the host.
	 *		If the dstid parameter is a cryptographic EID,
	 *		which is inherently location-independent,
	 *		SST may need a location hint to find the remote host
	 *		if this host and the remote host are not currently
	 *		registered at a common registration server,
	 *		for example.
	 *		This parameter is not needed
	 *		if the dstid is a non-cryptographic legacy address.
